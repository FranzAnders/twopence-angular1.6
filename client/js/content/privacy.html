We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Data You Provide to Us</strong></p>
        <p><br /> We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses, country, telephone number, tax identification number (e.g., social security number or employer identification number), age, bank account information and password, when you register for the Pickpocket Service. In order to make and receive payments, Users must provide to us their legal name, legal entity type (if applicable), tax identification number (e.g., social security number or employer identification number), date of birth or date of formation, physical address, country, student loan information (if applicable), bank account number, and bank routing number. In addition, we (or our third-party partners, including Dwolla, on our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your account information to help provide the Pickpocket Service.

A recurring subscription will be created at our payment gateway, which will store your billing information for as long as necessary to carry out the terms of your subscription. Should you cancel your subscription, your billing information will be promptly removed by our payment gateway.</p>
